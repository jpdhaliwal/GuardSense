# GuardSense
A taekwondo chest guard designed for training with the use of minigames. 

My project is a taekwondo chest guard. The twist to this is that there is a coded circuit attached to this chest guard which allows the user access to 3 
activities which they can participate in using the buttons on the side. These activities are sort of like a mini game where the user will play them and 
have their final score stored on a google sheet. At the end of each exercise the user gets a chance to view their latest score, best score and average 
score, all of which are calculated on the google sheet using the previous data from the raspberry pi. All of the activities are explained on the LCD display 
and so are the stats which are displayed at the end of each activity. These activities can be repeated and started right after another and the circuit will 
turn off only when an input is inputted on the keyboard attached to the raspberry pi. In this case the input is “ctrl + c”. All of the circuitry is on the 
inside of the chest guard with only the LCD and buttons being exposed on the front side.
